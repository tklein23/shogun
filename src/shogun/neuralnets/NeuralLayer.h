/** @brief Base class for neural network layers
 * 
 * A Neural layer represents an group of neurons and is the basic building block
 * for neural networks.
 * 
 * This class is to be inherited from to implement layers with different neuron
 * types (i.e linear, softmax, convolutional, etc..)
 *
 * Any arbitrary layer type can be derived from this class provided that the 
 * following functions have been defined in a mathematically plausible manner:
 * - initialize_parameters()
 * - get_num_parameters()
 * - compute_activations()
 * - compute_gradients()
 * - compute_error() [only if the layer can be used as an output layer]
 * - enforce_max_norm()
 * 
 * The memory for the layer's parameters (weights and biases) is not allocated
 * by the layer itself, instead it is allocated by the network that the layer
 * belongs to, and passed to the layer when it needs to use it.
 * 
 * This class stores buffers for use during forward and backpropagation, this is
 * to avoid unnecessary memory allocation during computations. The buffers are:
 * m_activations: size m_num_neurons*m_batch_size
 * m_input_gradients: size m_num_neurons*m_previous_layer_num_neurons
 * m_local_gradients: size m_num_neurons*m_batch_size
