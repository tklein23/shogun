      "Decision Trees are a non-parametric supervised learning method that can be used for both classification and regression. Decision trees essentially encode a set of if-then-else rules which can be used to predict target variable given data features. These if-then-else rules are formed using the training dataset with the aim to satisfy as many training data instances as possible. The formation of these rules (aka. decision tree) from training data is called decision tree learning. Various decision tree learning algorithms have been developed and they work best in different situations. An advantage of decision trees is that they can model any type of function for classification or regression which other techniques cannot. But a decision tree is highly prone to overfitting and bias towards training data. So, decision trees are used for very large datasets which are assumed to represent the ground truth well. Additionally, certain [tree pruning algorithms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pruning_%28decision_trees%29) are also used to tackle overfitting.   "

      "ID3 is a straightforward decision tree learning algorithm developed by [Ross Quinlan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ross_Quinlan). ID3 is applicable only in cases where the attributes (or features) defining data examples are categorical in nature and the data examples belong to pre-defined, clearly distinguishable (ie. well defined) classes. ID3 is an iterative greedy algorithm which starts with the root node and eventually builds the entire tree. At each node, the \"best\" attribute to classify data is chosen. The \"best\" attribute is chosen using the [information gain metric](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_gain_in_decision_trees). Once an attribute is chosen in a node, the data examples in the node are categorized into sub-groups based on the attribute values that they have. Basically, all data examples having the same attribute value are put together in the same sub-group. These sub-groups form the children of the present node and the algorithm is repeated for each of the newly formed children nodes. This goes on until all the data members of a node belong to the same class or all the attributes are exhausted. In the latter case, the class predicted may be erroneous and generally the mode of the classes appearing in the node is chosen as the predictive class. "
